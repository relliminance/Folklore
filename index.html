        <p> You booked the night train for a <strong>reason,</strong> 
        So you could <strong>sit there in this hurt</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Bustling crowds or silent sleepers,
        You're not sure which is worse.</p>
        
        <p>I </strong>dropped your hand</strong> while dancing,
        Left you out there </strong>standing.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Crestfallen </strong>  on the landing,
        Champagne problems.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The first line indicates that the person sat
                on a train for a purpose and it is to feel the pain in him.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Even if there's so many people in the train and people who sleep,
                inside of him, he's so confused if there's much worse than what he's feeling. </li>
        </ol>
